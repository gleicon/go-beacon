# Simple tracker based on Navigation Timing API

A simple tracker that collects Navigation Timing API, timers and js exceptions. Events are intercepted to collect data and all calculations are made client-side. 
It inserts a 1x1px image into the page and have to be loaded at the <head> section.
All javascript events are stubbed (i.e. if you already have a function mapped to window.onload it will be called after the tracker

## Why not boomerang.js

Boomerang is pretty good and you should probably be using it. 
This code was made to work with modern browsers and collect specific metrics without plugins or build stage.
It's also smaller than a regular boomerang build.

## Query string and parameters

This tracker returns a couple of events by query string (t= parameter)
    
    u - on before unload metrics: beforeunloadtime, start, total_elapsed_time, type_navigate(RELOAD, BACK_FORWARD, NAVIGATE)
    p - performance data: page_load_time, tcp_time, dns_time, processing_time, processing_time
    e - errors: JSON containing: {"msg":error msg, "url": url, "line": line that the error ocurred}
    g - geolocation info (if geo == true on activate()): JSON object containing 
            {"lat": position.coords.latitude, "long": position.coords.longitude} (it will ask for user permission)
    
## Add to your page, at the <head> section

    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://location.of.track.js/js/track.js"></script>
    <script>
        activate("http://location.of.your.beacon/t.gif", "tracker_name");
    </script>
