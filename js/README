# Simple tracker based on Navigation Timing API

A simple tracker that collects Navigation Timing API, timers and js exceptions. 
It inserts a 1x1px image into the page and have to be loaded at the <head> section.
All javascript events are stubbed (i.e. if you already have a function mapped to window.onload it will be called after the tracker.

## Query string and parameters

This js tracker returns a couple of events by query string
    
    u - on before unload metrics: beforeunloadtime, start, total_elapsed_time, type_navigate(RELOAD, BACK_FORWARD, NAVIGATE)
    p - performance data: page_load_time, tcp_time, dns_time, processing_time, processing_time
    e - errors: JSON containing: {"msg":error msg, "url": url, "line": line that the error ocurred}
    g - geolocation info (if geo == true on activate()): JSON object containing 
            {"lat": position.coords.latitude, "long": position.coords.longitude} (it will ask for user permission)
