Boomerang build system.

We assume the method called "The faster, more involved, asynchronous way" to load boomerang (https://github.com/lognormal/boomerang/)
It can be easily changed to build a regular boomerang.js build by removing async_loading.js from the plugin list.

To build:
- Edit async_loading.js to configure your beacon url (complete URL to the gif image)
- type make

The final boomerang file will be at ../assets/public_html/js.
